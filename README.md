## **Overview**

This project explores the potential of **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** in revolutionizing modern navigation systems. By integrating graph-based learning, it optimizes route calculations and dynamically adapts to changing traffic, environmental, and contextual factors.

### **Why This Project?**

- Traditional algorithms like Dijkstraâ€™s and A\* face scalability and dynamic adaptation challenges.
- GNNs bring the power of deep learning to graph structures, enabling smarter, faster, and more efficient navigation solutions.

## **Features**

- **Dynamic Routing**: Adapts routes based on real-time data.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Handles large-scale graph data with ease.
- **Customizability**: Integrate various data sources like traffic, weather, or user preferences.
- **AI-Powered Predictions**: Learns from historical data for predictive routing.
